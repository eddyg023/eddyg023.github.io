### Catalog Application

- This project entails developing a lending catalog application, facilitating users to share items among themselves. 
Building upon prior experience creating a book data application, the design extends functionality to include importing 
data from text files, encompassing a broader dataset of movies and tools. The application will utilize Java programming 
language and IntelliJ IDEA as the development environment. Key objectives include implementing robust file I/O mechanisms, 
designing class structures for various item types, and enhancing the user interface for efficient item sharing and retrieval.
