### Catalog Application

- This project entails developing a lending catalog application that facilitates users sharing items among
 themselves. Building upon prior experience creating a book data application, the design extends functionality to include importing
 data from text files, encompassing a broader dataset of movies and tools. The application will utilize Java programming language
 and IntelliJ IDEA as the development environment. Key objectives include implementing robust file I/O mechanisms, designing
 class structures for various item types, and enhancing the user interface for efficient item sharing and retrieval.

### Team Web Service

- Developed a sports team management application using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, featuring a REST API
 with secure, authenticated endpoints for managing team and player data. The project employed the DAO pattern for database
 operations and included a SQL script for initializing tables and mock data. Database integration testing ensured reliability, and the
 application leveraged an external API to enhance functionality. The solution provided a clear utility for effectively managing sports
 teams and players.
